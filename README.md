## Some infos

A simple digit clock using NTP written in Micropython. 

I used a Raspberry Pi Pico W and added only an LDR to adjust automatically the brightness of the display.

The 3D printed housing was created with FreeCAD. I used transparent PLA filament. You need a 300mm² square bed print the front (45° rotation).
